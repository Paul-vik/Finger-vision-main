## 🧠 What is FingerVision?

FingerVision is a **real-time hand tracking web app** that uses computer vision to detect and track your fingers through a webcam.

It allows you to:

* Interact with your screen using gestures
* Track fingertip positions
* Draw in the air like magic ✨

## ✨ Features

* 🖐 **Real-time Hand Tracking** using MediaPipe
* 🔢 **Finger Counting** (supports both hands)
* 🎯 **Fingertip Coordinate Tracking**
* ✏️ **Air Drawing Mode**
* 🧭 **Left & Right Hand Detection**
* 🎨 **Futuristic UI Design**
* ⚡ **Ultra-smooth real-time performance**

## 🏛️ System Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    participant U as User
    participant C as Camera
    participant JS as JavaScript
    participant AI as MediaPipe
    participant UI as Canvas

    loop Real-Time Processing
        U->>C: Show hand gesture
        C->>JS: Send video frame

        JS->>AI: Process frame
        AI-->>JS: Return landmarks

        JS->>JS: Calculate finger positions
        JS->>UI: Draw on canvas

        UI-->>U: Display output
    end
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Webcam captures live video
2. MediaPipe detects hand landmarks (21 key points)
3. JavaScript processes coordinates
4. UI renders tracking + drawing in real-time
